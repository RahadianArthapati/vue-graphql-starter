I use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com) for package manager


>1. create simple API with [**`graphcool`**][gc]
>> paste your endpoint here
#### main.js
```javascript
const networkInterface = createNetworkInterface({ uri: 'your-end-point' });
```
>2. type **_`yarn`_** in root project to install dependencies
>3. run the dev server with **_`yarn run start`_**</b>
